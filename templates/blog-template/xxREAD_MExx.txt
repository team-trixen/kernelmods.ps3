Hello,

I wanted to clarify something. Make sure that when you copy this template file to Blog folder you Name it like this: Name of the blog (e.g Xeon_492_Released.html) and just edit everything that Blog post includes, Also it is optional you can upload Screenshots if needed! If you want to add screenshots to the blog, Put them in folder: Assets/Images, name them as html's blog name to avoid conflict
